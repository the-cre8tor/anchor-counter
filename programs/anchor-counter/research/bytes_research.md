Is u64 equal to 8 byte?

Yes, u64 (unsigned 64-bit integer) is equal to 8 bytes.

This is because:

1. 1 byte = 8 bits
2. 64 bits = 8 bytes (64 รท 8 = 8)

So a u64 data type, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer, takes up 8 bytes of memory. This is true across most modern computer architectures and programming languages that implement u64.

Similarly:

- u8 = 1 byte
- u16 = 2 bytes
- u32 = 4 bytes
- u64 = 8 bytes
- u128 = 16 bytes
